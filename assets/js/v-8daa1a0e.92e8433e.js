Apple&#39;s mobile operating system is known for its security and that&#39;s partly because of how locked-down it is. Jailbreaking your device will allow you to break those restrictions and customize your device to how you like it.</p><p>Jailbreaking gives you the ability to install custom applications and &quot;tweaks&quot; (modifications) from a package manager to customize and enhance the user experience. Jailbreaking is free and easy on most devices.</p><h2 id="is-jailbreaking-legal" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#is-jailbreaking-legal" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Is jailbreaking legal?</h2><p>Jailbreaking in the US is perfectly legal. In 2010, the US Copyright Office declared jailbreaking to be an exception to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p><p>You may want to check in your country whether it is legal there or not before proceeding, however in most countries it should be fine.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-package-manager" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-package-manager" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is a package manager?</h2><p>Package managers are used to install, uninstall and modify official and community-made software to customize your device. Sileo is an example of a package manager.</p><p>They can be considered similar to the iOS App Store, where you can install both free and paid software.</p><h2 id="what-are-tweaks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-tweaks" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What are tweaks?</h2><p>Tweaks are typically software packages that can be installed to your device which transform the look and feel of your iOS device. With some exceptions, tweaks usually don&#39;t come with an app icon, but rather instead an area in the Settings app to change how the tweak acts. Simpler tweaks might not have these.</p><h2 id="what-can-i-do-once-jailbroken" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-can-i-do-once-jailbroken" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What can I do once jailbroken?</h2><ul><li>Gain full access to your device&#39;s OS</li><li>Get access to a package manager, such as Sileo</li><li>Install themes to change the look and feel of your device</li><li>Install tweaks to change how iOS behaves</li></ul><h2 id="what-should-i-know-before-starting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-should-i-know-before-starting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What should I know before starting?</h2><div class="custom-container danger"><p class="custom-container-title">DANGER</p><p>Before following the steps of this guide, you must know the risks of jailbreaking: Every time you modify your system in any way, there is always a chance that you could lose user data and ability to jailbreak.
