This type of jailbreak requires an exploit to be executed every time you reboot or turn off your device.</p><img src="/assets/images/odysseymain.png" width="180" alt="A screenshot of the Odyssey jailbreak" class="align-right"><p>This jailbreak works by running the exploit through an app on the device itself. The app, however, must be resigned every 7 days if sideloaded with a standard Apple ID. Utilities like AltStore, ReProvision Reborn, and AltDaemon make this process far easier.</p><p>Due to the nature of how the exploit is applied, these jailbreaks are easily removable through their respective app.</p><p>A few examples of semi-untethered jailbreaks include <a href="installing-taurine">Taurine</a>, <a href="installing-unc0ver">unc0ver</a>, and <a href="installing-odyssey">Odyssey</a>.</p><h3 id="semi-tethered-jailbreaks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#semi-tethered-jailbreaks" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Semi-Tethered Jailbreaks</h3><hr><p>Semi-tethered jailbreaks are very similar to semi-untethered jailbreaks, however the exploit must be ran using a computer rather than using a sideloaded app.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/checkra1n.png" alt="A screenshot of the checkra1n jailbreak"></p><p>Due to requiring a computer to rejailbreak after every reboot, most choose to use a semi-untethered jailbreak instead.</p><p>An example of a semi-tethered jailbreak is <a href="installing-odysseyra1n">Odysseyra1n</a>.</p><h3 id="tethered-jailbreaks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tethered-jailbreaks" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Tethered Jailbreaks</h3><hr><p>Tethered jailbreaks are not meant to be used by the general public.
